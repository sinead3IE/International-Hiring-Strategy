Using the 2017 - 2020 Stack Overflow dataset, we look at the data to help identify what specific features companies should promote when trying to recruit in different countries. 

**Questions asked**
3 questions were asked and answered using the 2017 - 2020 Stack Overflow dataset saved on my local drive. Questions were:
1) How many respondents per country per year?
2) What Language & Database were people more interested in for the top 5 countries? 
3) Predicting those from Country_India

**Libraries used:**
There were a number of python libraries that were used to answer these 3 questions - all of which can be seen in the script. 
There are too many to be included here.

**Motivation for project**
The motivation for this was an interest in where the respondants to the Stack Overflow were from and what they are interested in.

I downloaded the 2018, 2018, 2019 and 2020 Stack Overflow datasets in csv format and saved them on my local drive.

5) Predicting those from Country_India
We prepared the data to ensure the model was training on the top features and checked a number of models to ensure we are using the model with the highest cross validation accuracy.
